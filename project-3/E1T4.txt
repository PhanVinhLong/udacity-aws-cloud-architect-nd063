Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
The InstanceRole has the permission to do any s3 actions on any s3 buckets, which violate the least privilige principle.
The InstanceRole should has only get permission to the S3BucketRecipesFree bucket.

# Poor practice 2
The web service instance is deployed to a public subnet. It should be deployed in a private subnet.

# Poor practice 3
All service security groups allows any inbound and outbound traffics. They should allows needed traffics only.
